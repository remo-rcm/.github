* A model description can be found [here](https://www.remo-rcm.de/059966/index.php.en). 
* Research projects using REMO for creating regional climate information are described [here](https://www.remo-rcm.de/060230/index.php.en).
* Current and former staff involved in the REMO development is listed [here](https://www.remo-rcm.de/060258/index.php.en).
* A list of publications is located [here](https://www.remo-rcm.de/059965/index.php.en).
